    <para>
      GFreenect is a GObject wrapper to libfreenect, a library to access and
      control the Microsoft(tm) Kinect(tm) sensor.
    </para>

    <para>
      Its main purpose is to provide smooth integration between the Kinect
      and GNOME technologies such as Clutter and GTK. This essentially means
      that GFreenect integrates nicely with a GLib main loop, and provides
      a fully asynchronous API to prevent blocking operations from
      affecting the applications' main flow.
    </para>

    <para>
      GFreenect intends to provide also a synchronous API, but it is still
      work in progress.
